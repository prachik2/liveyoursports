Its purpose is simple: to transmit your heart rate to your wrist unit. Slim and light, the ECG (electrocardiogram) accurate transmitter is fully water resistant and designed for all weather conditions. Compatible heart rate monitors include, but are not limited to: FT1, FT2, FT4, FT7, FT40, FT60, FT80, RS100, RS300X, RS400, RCX5. Slim, lightweight, and water-resistant, the Polar T31 coded transmitter and belt set accurately transmits your heart rate data to your Polar wrist-top computer. As a result, it's easy to monitor your heart rate during training runs. This version of the T31 coded, meaning it prevents crosstalk from other electronic devices to ensure complete accuracy (Polar also sells a non-coded T31). It's also built to last, with a design that holds up to 2,500 hours of training usage. The transmitter belt--which works with all current Polar wrist-top computers except the CS600 and RS800--includes a sealed transmitter and elastic strap. The first EKG accurate wireless heart rate monitor was invented by Polar back in 1977 as a training tool for the Finnish National Cross Country Ski Team. The concept of ""intensity training"" by heart rate swept the athletic world in the eighties. By the 1990s, individuals were looking to heart rate monitors not only for performance training needs, but also for achieving everyday fitness goals. Today, the same concept of heart rate training is being used by world-class athletes as well as everyday people trying to lose weight. Polar is the leading brand among consumers, coaches, and personal trainers worldwide and the company is committed to not only producing the best products, but also being the leading educator on the benefits of heart rate based exercise.",Polar T31 Coded Transmitter and Belt Set*
